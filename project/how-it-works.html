                <h2>1. Decentralized Oracles</h2>
                <p>Smart contracts on the blockchain cannot access data or APIs by themselves. Chainlink solves this
                    with its network of decentralized oracles, which are nodes that collect real-world information
                    and securely send it to the blockchain. Decentralization is key: instead of a single source,
                    Chainlink uses a network of independent oracles to obtain the same information. This ensures the
                    data is reliable and cannot be manipulated by a single source.</p>

                <h2>2. Data Feeds</h2>
                <p>Chainlink's data feeds are collections of on-chain data, such as real-time price information or
                    the results of off-chain events. These feeds are continuously and securely updated by the
                    decentralized oracle network. Developers can use these data feeds directly in their smart contracts,
                    which allows them to create complex applications that react to real-world changes, such as DeFi
                    liquidations or betting resolutions.</p>

                <h2>3. CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)</h2>
                <p>CCIP is Chainlink's open-source standard for cross-chain interoperability. It allows developers to
                    securely and reliably send data and tokens between different blockchains, such as Ethereum and
                    Solana. This is fundamental for building applications that span across multiple chains, opening up a
                    new universe of possibilities for Web3 development. With CCIP, assets and data can flow so a
                    unified, connecting ecosystems that were previously isolated.</p>
